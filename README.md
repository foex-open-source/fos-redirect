<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The <strong>FOS - Redirect</strong> dynamic action plug-in is an easy and declarative way to redirect to another page, URL, or open a modal dialog.</p>
<p>You have the ability to redirect to a static URL (with substitutions) or a URL that is returned from a PL/SQL Expression.</p>
<p>Additionally you can submit page items and update their session state prior to the URL redirect and optionally execute some PL/SQL Code. The URL will be recomputed on the server when doing this. If you are using session state protection it will return the URL with updated checksums.</p>
